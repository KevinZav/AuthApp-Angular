# AuthApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.1.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Backend

This app works using the [Ecommerce backend](https://github.com/KevinZav/ecommerce-backend) of another application developed in NestJS. The NestJS application, for the moment, only creates users, roles and authentication, but it also has implemented the processes for authentication and authorization of users in certain services.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
